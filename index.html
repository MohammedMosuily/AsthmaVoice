            <h2>Welcome to the AsthmaVoice Study</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>AsthmaVoice Study</strong>, conducted at the <strong>University of Southampton</strong>, explores how speech data 
                can be used to predict asthma exacerbations. This research integrates advanced speech analysis with traditional monitoring to 
                transform asthma care and improve early intervention strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This study is being conducted by <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mohammed-mosuily/bio" target="_blank">Mohammed Mosuily</a></strong>, 
                a PhD student at the University of Southampton, under the supervision of

            <h2>About the Study</h2>
            <p>
                AsthmaVoice is an innovative research project designed to explore whether speech characteristics, such as tone, rhythm, and pauses, can predict asthma exacerbations. 
                By combining speech analysis with traditional asthma monitoring methods, this study aims to develop tools for earlier detection and better management of asthma.
            </p>
            <h3>Objectives of the Study</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze the relationship between speech patterns and asthma symptoms.</li>
                <li>Improve asthma management by providing early warnings for exacerbations.</li>
                <li>Reduce healthcare burdens by enabling personalized, non-invasive monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Will the Study Work?</h3>
            <p>
                Participants will use the AsthmaVoice app to record structured and spontaneous speech tasks. These recordings, combined with questionnaires and environmental data, 
                will be analyzed to identify changes in speech patterns that correlate with asthma severity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data collection will take place over a 3â€“6 month period, ensuring enough variability in asthma conditions and speech characteristics to create robust predictive models.
            </p>
            <h3>Participant Involvement</h3>
            <p>
                Participants are integral to the success of this study. Each participant will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Record speech tasks biweekly, including reading a passage and describing a picture.</li>
                <li>Fill out health and environmental questionnaires twice a week.</li>
                <li>Share data on air quality and weather conditions in their location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

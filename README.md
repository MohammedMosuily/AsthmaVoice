# AsthmaVoice

AsthmaVoice is an innovative research project aimed at utilizing speech data to predict asthma exacerbations. This project is conducted at the **University of Southampton** by **Mohammed Mosuily**, a PhD student, under the supervision of **Dr. Jagmohan Chauhan**.

## Purpose
The goal of the AsthmaVoice study is to explore how speech characteristics, such as pitch, loudness, and pauses, can be used in combination with traditional monitoring tools to provide early warnings for asthma exacerbations. By integrating advanced machine learning and speech analysis, this project aims to improve asthma management and patient outcomes.

## Features
- **Speech Analysis**: Collect and analyze speech data for asthma prediction.
- **Data Collection App**: An easy-to-use mobile app for users to record speech, environmental data, and health information.
- **Innovative Research**: Combines traditional asthma monitoring methods with cutting-edge AI and speech processing.

## App Availability
The AsthmaVoice app will soon be available on the **App Store** and **Google Play Store** for data collection.
